# Reduces size of context and hides
# files from Docker (can't COPY or ADD these)

# Note that typically the Docker context for various OHIF containers is the
# directory of this file (i.e. the root of the source). As such, this is
# the .dockerignore file for ALL Docker containers that are built. For example,
# the Docker containers built from the recipes in ./platform/app/.recipes will
# have this file as their .dockerignore.
