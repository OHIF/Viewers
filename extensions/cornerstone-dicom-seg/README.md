# dicom-seg
## Description

DICOM SEG read workflow. This extension will allow you to load a DICOM SEG image
and display it on OHIF. Currently Segmentations are loaded as a volumetric labelmap
and displayed as a 3D volume.

This extension provides a SEG viewport, which enables rendering and reviewing
of the DICOM SEG images. However, in order to fully load all the segments
you will need to click on the SEG Pill button on the viewport action bar
to fully load the segments.
