# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1.7-labs
# This dockerfile is used to publish the `ohif/app` image on dockerhub.
#
# It's a good example of how to build our static application and package it
# with a web server capable of hosting it as static content.
#
# docker build
# --------------
# If you would like to use this dockerfile to build and tag an image, make sure
# you set the context to the project's root directory:
# https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/
#
#
# SUMMARY
# --------------
# This dockerfile has two stages:
#
# 1. Building the React application for production
# 2. Setting up our Nginx (Alpine Linux) image w/ step one's output
