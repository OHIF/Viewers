/**
 * Checks if a screenshot of a specific element matches the expected screenshot.
 * It retries the check for a specified number of attempts with a delay between each attempt.
 * By default, the number of attempts is 10 and the delay is 500 milliseconds which results in a maximum wait time of 5 seconds.
 * Instead of sleeping idle prior to calling this function, simply adjust the attempts and delay parameters to achieve the desired wait time.
 * @param pageOrProps - The page to interact with or an object containing page and other properties
 * @param locator - The element to check for screenshot
 * @param screenshotPath - The path to save the screenshot
 * @param attempts - The number of attempts to check for screenshot
 * @param delay - The delay between attempts
 * @returns  True if the screenshot matches, otherwise throws an error
