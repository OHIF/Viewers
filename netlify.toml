# Redirects and headers are GLOBAL for all builds â€“ they do not get scoped to
# contexts no matter where you define them in the file.
# For context-specific rules, use _headers or _redirects files, which are
# PER-DEPLOY.
# The following redirect is intended for use with most SPAs that handle
# routing internally.
# By default, redirects won't be applied if there's a file with the same
# path as the one defined in the `from` property. Setting `force` to `true`
# will make the redirect rule take precedence over any existing files.
