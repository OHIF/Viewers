# Connecting to Image Archives

We support DIMSE and DICOMWeb. Which one to use is up to you and depends on your PACS system. DICOMWeb requires no setup on the PACS-side whatsoever, whereas DIMSE may require you to add the 'OHIFDCM' aeTitle to the known DICOM Modalities of your Archive. This is the case for Orthanc, for example (See https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers/wiki/Orthanc-with-DIMSE).
