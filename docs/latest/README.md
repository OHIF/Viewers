# Introduction

The [Open Health Imaging Foundation][ohif-org] (OHIF) Viewer is an open source,
web-based, medical imaging viewer. It can be configured to connect to Image
Archives that support [DicomWeb][dicom-web], and offers support for mapping to
proprietary API formats. OHIF maintained extensions add support for viewing,
annotating, and reporting on DICOM images in 2D (slices) and 3D (volumes).

The Open Health Imaging Foundation intends to provide a simple general purpose
DICOM Viewer which can be easily extended for specific uses. If you find
yourself unable to extend the viewer for your purposes, please reach out via our
[GitHub issues][gh-issues]. We are actively seeking feedback on ways to improve
our integration and extension points.
