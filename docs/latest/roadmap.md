# Roadmap

If you want to know what's planned for the very near future,
[check out our roadmap](https://ohif.canny.io/). The best way to influence when
and what is worked on is to contribute to the conversation by creating GitHub
issues, and contributing code through pull requests. OHIF's high level
priorities for the near future are:

- Feature parity with version 1
- Extension and configuration improvements with key integration partners
- Continued Developer Experience Improvements
- Segmentation Tools, and improved VTK.js support

More granular information will make it's way to the backlog as these items
become scoped for development by core maintainers.

> Don't hesitate to ask questions, propose features, or create pull requests.
> We're here, we're listening, and we're ready to build the best open source
> medical imaging viewer on the web.
