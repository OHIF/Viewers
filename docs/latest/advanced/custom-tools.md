# Tool Management

This is not yet exposed in an easy/convenient way. Most tools are currently
added by creating new Viewport, Toolbar, and SOPInstanceHandler extension
modules. You can read more about that approach in
[extensions](../extensions/index.md).

In the near future, we intend to improve the extensibility of tools for existing
Viewports (like our Cornerstone.js and VTK.js viewports).
