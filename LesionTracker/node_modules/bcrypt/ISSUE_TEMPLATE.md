Thanks for reporting a new issue with the node bcrypt module!

To help you resolve your issue faster please make sure you have done the following:

* Searched existing issues (even closed ones) for your same problem

* Read your npm error log for lines telling you what failed, usually it is a problem with not having the correct dependencies installed to build the native module

* What went wrong?
* What did you expect to happen?
