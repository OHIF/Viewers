# LesionTracker  
LesionTracker is an open source, zero-footprint image viewer focused on oncology clinical trial workflows. It is built using Meteor platform which enables modularity with a set of packages of the OHIF framework.  


### Why LesionTracker?  
LesionTracker brings an user experience for the basic tumor metrics through web browser. It provides a DICOM server for storing and streaming images to the viewer, tools for measuring and following lesions over time, and a database for measurements of overlay data. A web-based system for image assessments rather than a workstation-based installed application will improve workflow efficiency, enhance accessibility, and promote collaborative image review for the radiologists at cooperating cancer centers.
