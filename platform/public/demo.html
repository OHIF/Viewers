    <h1>Demo Page</h1>
    <p>This demo page shows how to include directories of content in the pluginConfig.json file.
      The idea is that it is possible to serve up non-compiled content such as the microscopy mode
      which will not be included in the compile of OHIF but can be included later on dynamically.
