# Getting Started

## Installation

> This component library is pre- v1.0. All realeases until a v1.0 have the
> possibility of introducing breaking changes. Please depend on an "exact"
> version in your projects to prevent issues caused by loose versioning.

Install `@ohif/ui` from npm:

```shell
// with npm
npm i @ohif/ui --save-exact

// with yarn
yarn add @ohif/ui --exact
```

## Usage

There is some setup required for `@ohif/ui`. We are working to eliminate these
requirements with the goal of providing ready to use components.

### External Dependencies

We have tried to keep the number of external dependencies limited to make setup
as easy as possible. You will, however, need to include either the default font
or the font you set for your theme:

```js
// Google Fonts, Roboto
'https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:100,300,400,500,700&display=swap';
```

`@ohif/ui` also looks for theme CSS variabled defined on `:root`. You can find a
list of variables [on the theming page](/styling-and-theming)

### Import & Use

You can use components in your React app:

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { LayoutButton } from '@ohif/ui';

class Example extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = {
      selectedCell: {
        className: 'hover',
        col: 1,
        row: 1,
      },
    };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <LayoutButton
        selectedCell={this.state.selectedCell}
        onChange={cell => this.setState({ selectedCell: cell })}
      />
    );
  }
}
```

> NOTE: It is heavily recommended that you use a CSS reset or normalize. As well
> as the following style: `* { Box-sizing: Border-box }`
