## Tools
This section displays all the available tools inside the mode.
## Measurement tools
The basic viewer comes with the following default measurement tools:

- Length Tool: Calculates the linear distance between two points in *mm*
- Bidirectional Tool: Creates a measurement of the longest diameter (LD) and longest perpendicular diameter (LPD) in *mm*
- Annotation: Used to create a qualitative marker with a freetext label
- Ellipse: Measures an elliptical area in *mm<sup>2</sup>* and Hounsfield Units (HU)

When a measurement tool is selected from the toolbar, it becomes the `active` tool. Use the caret to expand the measurement tools and select another tool.
<!-- We should add a smaller screenshot for each measurement tool. Maybe have a matrix with 4 identical sized screenshots in a box? Also we should make sure the screenshots have more realistic measurements -->

Click on the caret to expand the tool and choose from predefined W/L settings for common imaging scenarios.
