# Test Coverage

## Playwright


Here's the test coverage report for our Playwright tests. Keep in mind that this doesn't include our Cypress tests, so our actual test coverage is likely higher than what's shown. We're focusing on Playwright for future OHIF testing, and we're really pushing to improve that coverage number.
