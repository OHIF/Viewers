# General FAQ


## How do I report a bug?

Navigate to our [GitHub Repository][new-issue], and submit a new bug report.
Follow the steps outlined in the [Bug Report Template][bug-report-template].

## How can I request a new feature?

At the moment we are in the process of defining our roadmap and will do our best
to communicate this to the community. If your requested feature is on the
roadmap, then it will most likely be built at some point. If it is not, you are
welcome to build it yourself and [contribute it](../development/contributing.md).
If you have resources and would like to fund the development of a feature,
please [contact us](https://ohif.org/get-support).


## Who should I contact about Academic Collaborations?

[Gordon J. Harris](https://www.dfhcc.harvard.edu/insider/member-detail/member/gordon-j-harris-phd/)
at Massachusetts General Hospital is the primary contact for any academic
collaborators. We are always happy to hear about new groups interested in using
the OHIF framework, and may be able to provide development support if the
proposed collaboration has an impact on cancer research.

## Does OHIF offer support?

yes, you can contact us for more information [here](https://ohif.org/get-support)


## Does The OHIF Viewer have [510(k) Clearance][501k-clearance] from the U.S. F.D.A or [CE Marking][ce-marking] from the European Commission?

**NO.** The OHIF Viewer is **NOT** F.D.A. cleared or CE Marked. It is the users'
responsibility to ensure compliance with applicable rules and regulations. The
[License](https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers/blob/master/LICENSE) for the OHIF
Platform does not prevent your company or group from seeking F.D.A. clearance
for a product built using the platform.

If you have gone this route (or are going there), please let us know because we
would be interested to hear about your experience.

## Is there a DICOM Conformance Statement for the OHIF Viewer?

## Is The OHIF Viewer [HIPAA][hipaa-def] Compliant?

Compliant. It is the users' responsibility to ensure compliance with applicable
rules and regulations.
