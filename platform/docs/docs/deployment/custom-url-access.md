# Hosting the Web Viewer on a Custom URL Path

You can host the viewer on a subpath like `/abc` instead of the root `/`. There are **two levels** of customization depending on how you want to serve your static assets.


## Simple Setup (Recommended for Most Use Cases)

If you want to make the viewer accessible from a custom path (e.g. `/abc`) and **don‚Äôt care where the assets are loaded from** (they‚Äôll be fetched from the root `/`), this setup is for you.

### What You Get

- Viewer available at `https://yourdomain.com/abc`
- All assets (JS, WASM, etc.) still loaded from the root (`/app.js`, `/viewer.wasm`, etc.)

### How To Set It Up

1. Set `routerBasename` in your config file (e.g., `config/myConfig.js`) to `/abc`
2. Build the viewer with:

```bash
APP_CONFIG=config/myConfig.js yarn build
```

### Local Development

```bash
APP_CONFIG=config/myConfig.js yarn dev
```

##  Advanced Setup (Custom Asset Path)

If you want to host the viewer at `/abc` **and** serve static assets from a different location (e.g. `/my-private-assets`), this is a more advanced scenario.

### What You Get

- Viewer accessible from `https://yourdomain.com/abc`
- All assets loaded from `https://yourdomain.com/my-private-assets/`

### Why This is Tricky

Some libraries (especially ones using WASM) load assets using **relative paths**, which can break if not handled carefully. To solve this:

- Set `routerBasename` to `/abc`
- Set `PUBLIC_URL` to `/my-private-assets/`
- Webpack will load assets from the specified public URL.

### Local Development Notes

In development, use proxy rewrites to handle relative asset paths. Example for `dicom-microscopy-viewer`:

```js
proxy: {
  '/dicom-microscopy-viewer': {
    target: 'http://localhost:3000',
    pathRewrite: {
      '^/dicom-microscopy-viewer': `/${PUBLIC_URL}/dicom-microscopy-viewer`,
    },
  },
}
```

This ensures local development can find assets even when libraries expect them at certain paths.


### Building and Serving in Production

To build the viewer for production:

```bash
PUBLIC_URL=/my-private-assets/ APP_CONFIG=config/myConfig.js yarn build
```

If you're using `npx serve`, make sure to update `serve.json`:

```json
{
  "rewrites": [{ "source": "*", "destination": "/abc/index.html" }]
}
```

Serve the viewer like this:

```bash
cd platform/app
mv dist abc  # Rename dist folder to match your viewer route
npx serve -c ./public/serve.json
```

### üê≥ Using Docker? You're Covered

If you‚Äôre using our Dockerfile, you‚Äôre all set ‚Äî it already handles copying specific asset folders (like `dicom-microscopy-viewer`) to the root:

```Dockerfile
COPY --from=builder /usr/src/app/platform/app/dist/dicom-microscopy-viewer /usr/share/nginx/html/dicom-microscopy-viewer
```

Keep an eye on the browser network tab for any assets that might fail to load ‚Äî if any other libraries require similar treatment, you‚Äôll need to handle those as well.

| Goal                              | routerBasename | PUBLIC_URL           | Assets Load From        |
|-----------------------------------|----------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| Viewer at `/abc`, assets from `/` | `/abc`         | default                   | Root `/`                 |
| Viewer at `/abc`, assets from `/my-private-assets` | `/abc`         | `/my-private-assets/`  | `/my-private-assets/`    |
