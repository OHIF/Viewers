The [Open Health Imaging Foundation][ohif-org] (OHIF) Viewer is an open source,
web-based, medical imaging platform. It aims to provide a core framework for
building complex imaging applications.

Key features:

- Designed to load large radiology studies as quickly as possible. Retrieves
  metadata ahead of time and streams in imaging pixel data as needed.
- Leverages [Cornerstone3D](https://github.com/cornerstonejs/cornerstone3D-beta) for decoding,
  rendering, and annotating medical images.
- Works out-of-the-box with Image Archives that support [DICOMWeb][dicom-web].
  Offers a Data Source API for communicating with archives over proprietary API
  formats.
- Provides a plugin framework for creating task-based workflow modes which can
  re-use core functionality.
- Beautiful user interface (UI) designed with extensibility in mind. UI
  components available in a reusable component library built with React.js and
  Tailwind CSS

## Where to next?

The Open Health Imaging Foundation intends to provide an imaging viewer
framework which can be easily extended for specific uses. If you find yourself
unable to extend the viewer for your purposes, please reach out via our [GitHub
issues][gh-issues]. We are actively seeking feedback on ways to improve our
integration and extension points.
