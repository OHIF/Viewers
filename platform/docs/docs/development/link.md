# Introduction

Local linking allows you to develop and test a library in the context of an application before it's published or when you encounter
a bug that you suspect is related to a library. With Yarn, this can be achieved through the yarn link command.

You can take a look at the Cornerstonejs tutorial for linking https://www.cornerstonejs.org/docs/contribute/linking
