:::info
This migration involves significant architectural changes to the segmentation system. While we typically aim for incremental updates, the shift from a tool group-centric to a viewport-centric architecture was necessary to support OHIF 3.9's advanced visualization capabilities, and more flexible segmentation handling.

Don't worry - we'll guide you through each change step by step!
