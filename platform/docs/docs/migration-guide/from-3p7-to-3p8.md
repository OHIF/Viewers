# Migration Guide

There are two main things that need to be taken care of.


## New Toolbar Button definitions

### Update Active Tool Handling
The concept of `activeTool` and its associated getter and setter has been removed. The active tool should now be derived from the toolGroup and the viewport.


**Action Needed**

Remove any code that sets the default tool using `toolbarService.setDefaultTool()` and activates the tool using
`toolbarService.recordInteraction()`. For example, the following code should be removed:

```javascript
let unsubscribe;
toolbarService.setDefaultTool({
  groupId: "WindowLevel",
  itemId: "WindowLevel",
  interactionType: "tool",
  commands: [
    {
      commandName: "setToolActive",
      commandOptions: {
        toolName: "WindowLevel",
      },
      context: "CORNERSTONE",
    },
  ],
});

const activateTool = () => {
  toolbarService.recordInteraction(toolbarService.getDefaultTool());

  unsubscribe();
};

({ unsubscribe } = toolGroupService.subscribe(
  toolGroupService.EVENTS.VIEWPORT_ADDED,
  activateTool
));
```



Instead, focus on defining the buttons and their placement in the toolbar using `toolbarService.addButtons()` and `toolbarService.createButtonSection()`. For example:

```javascript
toolbarService.addButtons([...toolbarButtons, ...moreTools]);
toolbarService.createButtonSection("primary", [
  "MeasurementTools",
  "Zoom",
  "WindowLevel",
  "Pan",
  "Capture",
  "Layout",
  "MPR",
  "Crosshairs",
  "MoreTools",
]);
```


### Update Button Definitions
The concept of button types (toggle, action, tool) has been removed. Buttons are now defined using a simplified object-based definition.

**Action Needed**

Update your button definitions to use the new object-based format and remove the `type` property. Use the `uiType` property for the top-level UI type definition. For example:

```javascript
// Old Implementation
{
  id: 'Capture',
  type: 'ohif.action',
  props: {
    icon: 'tool-capture',
    label: 'Capture',
    type: 'action',
    commands: [
      {
        commandName: 'showDownloadViewportModal',
        commandOptions: {},
        context: 'CORNERSTONE',
      },
    ],
  },
},
```

is now

```javascript
// New Implementation
{
  id: 'Capture',
  uiType: 'ohif.radioGroup',
  props: {
    icon: 'tool-capture',
    label: 'Capture',
    commands: [
      {
        commandName: 'showDownloadViewportModal',
        context: 'CORNERSTONE',
      },
    ],
    evaluate: 'evaluate.action',
  },
},
```

### Add Evaluators to Button Definitions
Introduce the ï»¿evaluate property in your button definitions to determine the state of the button based on the app context.

**Action Needed**

Add the appropriate `evaluate` property to each button definition. For example:
   - Use `evaluate.cornerstoneTool` if the button should be highlighted only when it is the active primary tool (left mouse).
	- Use `evaluate.cornerstoneTool.toggle` if the tool is a toggle tool (like reference lines or image overlay).

Refer to the `modes/longitudinal/src/toolbarButtons.ts` file for examples of using the `evaluate` property.

Additional Resources

  - For more information on the new toolbar module and its usage, refer to the [Toolbar documentation](../platform/extensions/modules/toolbar.md).
  - Consult the updated button definitions in `modes/longitudinal/src/toolbarButtons.ts` for examples of the new object-based button definition format and the usage of evaluators.

## leftPanelDefaultClosed and rightPanelDefaultClosed

Now they are renamed to `leftPanelClosed` and `rightPanelClosed` respectively.


## StudyInstanceUID in the URL param

Previously there were two params that you could choose: seriesInstanceUID and seriesInstanceUIDs, they have been replaced with seriesInstanceUIDs so even if you would like to filter one series use ``seriesInstanceUIDs`
