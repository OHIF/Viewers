# Release Notes

> New `OHIF-v3` architecture has made OHIF a general purpose extensible medical
> imaging **platform**, as opposed to a configurable viewer.

## What's new in `OHIF-v3`

`OHIF-v3` is our second try for a React-based viewer, and is the third version
of our medical image web viewers from the start. The summary of changes includes:

- Addition of workflow modes
  - Often, medical imaging use cases involves lots of specific workflows that
    re-use functionalities. We have added the capability of workflow modes, that
    enable people to customize user interface and configure application for
    specific workflow.
  - The idea is to re-use the functionalities that extensions provide and create
    a workflow. Brain segmentation workflow is different from prostate
    segmentation in UI for sure; however, they share the segmentation tools that
    can be re-used.
  - Our vision is that technical people focus of developing extensions which
    provides core functionalities, and experts to build modes by picking the
    appropriate functionalities from each extension.
  - Migrated all the `cornerstone-core` and `cornerstone-tools` usage to the newly released `Cornerstone3D`.

* UI has been completely redesigned with modularity and workflow modes in mind.
* New UI components have been built with Tailwind CSS
* Redux store has been removed from the viewer in favour of services backed by
  React's Context **API**
