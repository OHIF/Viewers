## Previous V3 Releases (on `v3-stable` branch, before merge to `master`)

### OHIF Viewer v3.5 - Docker Build

This update represents a minor release that is primarily focused on enhancing the development environment of the OHIF Viewer. It achieves this by integrating Docker build support, which is essential for streamlining the deployment process and ensuring consistent environments. Additionally, in an effort to optimize the development workflow, this release takes care of pushing changes to the master branch. Furthermore, it strategically splits the master branch from the release branch. This separation is crucial as it allows the developers to work more efficiently on the ongoing developments in the master branch, while simultaneously ensuring that the release branch remains stable and well-maintained. Such an approach underlines the commitment to both innovation and reliability.

- Fast and Optimized Multiplanar Reconstruction (MPR): The viewer now supports MPR visualization of volumes and segmentations, leading to significantly reduced memory footprint and improved performance.

- New Collapsible Side Panels: The OHIF Viewer has redesigned side panels to be more compact and user friendly.

- Context-aware Drag and Drop via Hanging Protocols: The viewer now allows a more seamless experience when dragging and dropping thumbnails.

- New Tools: Two new tools have been added: Reference Lines and Stack Synchronizations.



### OHIF Viewer v3.2 - Mode Gallery & TMTV Mode (August 2022)

Check out the complete press announcement [here](https://ohif.org/newsletters/2022-08-18-mode%20gallery%20and%20tmtv%20mode).

- New Total Metabolic Tumor Volume (TMTV) Workflow: This new mode includes high-performance rendering of volumetric data in ten distinct viewports, fusion of two series with adjustable colormaps, synchronization of the viewports for both camera and VOI settings, jump-to-click capability to synchronize navigation in all viewports, and support for exporting results.

- OHIF Workflow Mode Gallery: This new feature is a one-stop shop for users to find, install, and use OHIF modes and share functionality with the community. The gallery is continuously updated with community-submitted modes.


### OHIF Viewer v3.1 - Cornerstone3D Integration (July 2022)

Check out the complete press announcement [here](https://ohif.org/newsletters/2022-07-28-ohif%20&%20cornerstone3d%20integratione).

- Cornerstone3D Integration: OHIF v3.1 has deprecated the legacy Cornerstone.js extension and replaced all functionality with Cornerstone3D. This includes updating the Measurement Tracking workflow mode.

- GPU Accelerated 2D Rendering: The Cornerstone3D rendering engine now supports WebGL 2D textures for large images, increasing the interaction speed significantly compared to the legacy Cornerstone.js engine.

- Upgraded Hanging Protocol Engine: The OHIF Hanging Protocol Engine has been updated for increased flexibility and ease of writing protocols. This includes the ability to position viewports in any non-grid layout and specify viewport configurations such as colormap, initial VOI, initial image to render, orientation, and more.


### OHIF Viewer v3.0 Public Beta Launch (September 2021)

Check out the complete press announcement [here](https://ohif.org/newsletters/2021-09-14-ohif%20update:%20v3%20public%20beta%20launch--release).

- UI has been completely redesigned with modularity and workflow modes in mind.
- New UI components have been built with Tailwind CSS
- Addition of workflow modes
  - Often, medical imaging use cases involves lots of specific workflows that
    re-use functionalities. We have added the capability of workflow modes, that
    enable people to customize user interface and configure application for
    specific workflow.
  - The idea is to re-use the functionalities that extensions provide and create
    a workflow. Brain segmentation workflow is different from prostate
    segmentation in UI for sure; however, they share the segmentation tools that
    can be re-used.
  - Our vision is that technical people focus of developing extensions which
    provides core functionalities, and experts to build modes by picking the
    appropriate functionalities from each extension.
