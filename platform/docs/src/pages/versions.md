# Versions

As we are increasing the efforts to make the OHIF platform more robust and up-to-date
with the latest software engineering practices, here we are listing the versions of
the OHIF platform that we are currently supporting, and the versions that have been
deprecated.

## Product Version


Currently we have three product versions:

- Version 1 (deprecated): Built with Meteor as a full stack application.
- Version 2 (deprecated): Front end image viewer built with React
- Version 3.x-beta (master branch): With latest bug fixes and features but not yet released (released under beta)
- Version 3.x (release branch): Released version of the OHIF platform which is more stable and tested


You can read more about the differences between the versions in the [development section](../../docs/development/getting-started#branches) of the documentation
to understand which version is more suitable for your use case.
