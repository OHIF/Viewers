## About

The OHIF Medical Imaging Viewer is for viewing medical images. It can retrieve
and load images from most sources and formats; render sets in 2D, 3D, and
reconstructed representations; allows for the manipulation, annotation, and
serialization of observations; supports internationalization, OpenID Connect,
offline use, hotkeys, and many more features.

Almost everything offers some degree of customization and configuration. If it
doesn't support something you need, we accept pull requests and have an ever
improving Extension System.

## Why Choose Us

### Community & Experience

The OHIF Viewer is a collaborative effort that has served as the basis for many
active, production, and FDA Cleared medical imaging viewers. It benefits from
our extensive community's collective experience, and from the sponsored
contributions of individuals, research groups, and commercial organizations.

### Built to Adapt

After more than 5-years of integrating with many companies and organizations,
The OHIF Viewer has been rebuilt from the ground up to better address the
varying workflow and configuration needs of its many users. All of the Viewer's
core features are built using it's own extension system. The same extensibility
that allows us to offer:

- 2D and 3D medical image viewing
- Multiplanar Reconstruction (MPR)
- Maximum Intensity Project (MIP)
- Whole slide microscopy viewing
- PDF and Dicom Structured Report rendering
- User Access Control (UAC)
- Context specific toolbar and side panel content
- and many others

Can be leveraged by you to customize the viewer for your workflow, and to add
any new functionality you may need (and wish to maintain privately without
forking).

### Support

We offer support through
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers/issues/new/choose). You can:

- [Report a Bug 🐛](https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Community%3A+Report+%3Abug%3A&template=---bug-report.md)

For commercial support, academic collaberations, and answers to common
questions; please read our
[documented FAQ](https://docs.ohif.org/faq/index.html#does-ohif-offer-commercial-support).

## Quick Start Deployment

> This is only one of many ways to configure and deploy the OHIF Viewer. To
> learn more about your options, and how to choose the best one for your
> requirements, check out
> [our deployment recipes and documentation](https://docs.ohif.org/deployment/).

The fastest and easiest way to get started is to include the OHIF Viewer with a
script tag. In practice, this is as simple as:

- Including the following dependencies with script tags:
  - [React](https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.production.min.js)
  - [React Dom](https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.production.min.js)
  - The [OHIF Viewer](https://unpkg.com/@ohif/viewer)
- Have an element with an ID of `root` on the page
- Configure the OHIF Viewer at `window.config`:

```js
window.config = {
  routerBasename: '/',
  servers: {
    dicomWeb: [
      {
        name: 'DCM4CHEE',
        qidoRoot: 'https://server.dcmjs.org/dcm4chee-arc/aets/DCM4CHEE/rs',
        wadoRoot: 'https://server.dcmjs.org/dcm4chee-arc/aets/DCM4CHEE/rs',
        qidoSupportsIncludeField: true,
        imageRendering: 'wadors',
        thumbnailRendering: 'wadors',
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

- Install the viewer:
  `window.OHIFStandaloneViewer.installViewer(window.config);`

This exact setup is demonstrated in this
[CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/viewer-script-tag-tprch) and in our
[Embedding The Viewer](https://docs.ohif.org/deployment/recipes/embedded-viewer.html)
deployment recipe.
