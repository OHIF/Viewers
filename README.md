# OHIF Export Extension - Medical Image Export Solution

**Developer:** [Junhu Jay Song]
**Date:** July 29, 2025
**Challenge:** OHIF Coding Challenge - Export Extension

> Built on the OHIF Medical Imaging Viewer - A zero-footprint medical image viewer provided by the [Open Health Imaging Foundation (OHIF)](https://ohif.org/)

## Overview

This project implements a custom OHIF extension and mode that enables users to export medical images from the active viewport and their DICOM metadata as downloadable ZIP files. The solution demonstrates proficiency in OHIF's extensible architecture, extension development, and medical imaging workflows.

## Features

- **One-Click Export**: Export current viewport image and metadata with a button click
- **DICOM Metadata Extraction**: Automatically extracts key patient and study information
- **ZIP File Generation**: Creates downloadable ZIP containing image.jpg and metadata.json
- **Integration**: Integrates into OHIF's interface using the extension system
- **Production Ready**: Built following OHIF's architectural patterns and best practices

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Node 18+](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Yarn 1.20.0+](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
- Git
- Yarn Workspaces enabled: `yarn config set workspaces-experimental true`

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/json0130/Viewers.git
  cd Viewers
  ```
2. **Install Dependencies**
  ```bash
  yarn install
  ```

3. **Start the Development Server**
  ```bash
  yarn dev
  ```

4. **Access the Application**
- Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000
- The OHIF Viewer should load with the export extension available

## Usage Instruction

### Activating Export Mode and Export ZIP file
1. Load OHIF Viewer in your browser
2. Select the Medical Study List you want to Export
3. Select "Export Mode" Button from the selected Study
4. Press the "Export ZIP" Button on the left-top cornernof the interface
5. Download Begins Automatically : A ZIP file will be downloaded to your default downloads folder
6. Verify Contents: The ZIP file contains:
- image.jpg - High-quality JPEG of the current viewport
- metadata.json - DICOM metadata including patient name, study date, and technical details

## Development Process & Approach
### Architecutre Decision
Following OHIF's recommended patterns, I implemented this feature using the extension and mode architecture:

#### 1. Extension (@ohif/extension-export): Contains all export-related business logic

- Command registration and execution (commandsModule.ts)
- Toolbar button definition (toolbarModule.ts)
- Image capture using Cornerstone3D viewport API
- DICOM metadata extraction from OHIF services
- Client-side ZIP file generation

#### 2. Mode (@ohif/mode-export): Provides the user interface context

- Tool configuration for medical image viewing
- Integration with OHIF's toolbar system
- Viewport and hanging protocol setup

### Technical Implementation & Code Quality Standards
TypeScript: Full TypeScript implementation following OHIF's patterns

Modular Design: Clean separation using OHIF's module system

Error Handling: Comprehensive error handling with user notifications & console.log

Performance: Optimized for medical imaging workflows

Extension Standards: Follows OHIF extension development best practices

### Challenges Encountered & Solutions
#### Challenge 1: OHIF Extension Integration
- Issue: Understanding OHIF's extension registration and toolbar integration system.
- Solution: Studied existing OHIF extensions (cornerstone, measurement-tracking) to understand patterns and implemented an approach ensuring reliable button placement.
- Learning: OHIF's extension system is sophisticated but requires an understanding of service dependencies.

#### Challenge 2: Medical Imaging Data Handling
- Issue: Ensuring proper DICOM metadata extraction while maintaining data integrity.
- Solution: Implemented metadata extraction using OHIF's display set services with comprehensive fallbacks for missing data.

### Assumptions Made

- OHIF Architecture: Assumed familiarity with OHIF's extension and mode system
- DICOM Standards: Followed the standard DICOM metadata structure for patient information
- Data Sources: Designed to work with OHIF's standard data sources

## Conclusion
This implementation successfully demonstrates a production-ready medical imaging export solution built on OHIF's architecture. The solution leverages OHIF's extensibility, making it the basis for medical imaging viewers and active production systems.

Following OHIF's architectural patterns and best practices, this extension integrates with the platform's features while providing export capabilities for clinical and research workflows.

The modular, service-oriented approach ensures compatibility with OHIF's ongoing development and positions the extension for integration into larger medical imaging solutions.
