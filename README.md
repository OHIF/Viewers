## About

The OHIF Medical Imaging Viewer is for viewing medical images. It can retrieve
and load images from most sources and formats; render sets in 2D, 3D, and
reconstructed representations; allows for the manipulation, annotation, and
serialization of observations; supports internationalization, OpenID Connect,
offline use, hotkeys, and many more features.

Almost everything offers some degree of customization and configuration. If it
doesn't support something you need, we accept pull requests and have an ever
improving Extension System.

## Why Choose Us

### Community & Experience

The OHIF Viewer is a collaborative effort that has served as the basis for many
active, production, and FDA Cleared medical imaging viewers. It benefits from
our extensive community's collective experience, and from the sponsored
contributions of individuals, research groups, and commercial organizations.

### Built to Adapt

After more than 8-years of integrating with many companies and organizations,
The OHIF Viewer has been rebuilt from the ground up to better address the
varying workflow and configuration needs of its many users. All of the Viewer's
core features are built using it's own extension system. The same extensibility
that allows us to offer:

- 2D and 3D medical image viewing
- Multiplanar Reconstruction (MPR)
- Maximum Intensity Project (MIP)
- Whole slide microscopy viewing
- PDF and Dicom Structured Report rendering
- Segmentation rendering as labelmaps and contours
- User Access Control (UAC)
- Context specific toolbar and side panel content
- and many others

Can be leveraged by you to customize the viewer for your workflow, and to add
any new functionality you may need (and wish to maintain privately without
forking).

## Developing

### Branches

#### `master` branch - The latest dev (beta) release

- `master` - The latest dev release

This is typically where the latest development happens. Code that is in the master branch has passed code reviews and automated tests, but it may not be deemed ready for production. This branch usually contains the most recent changes and features being worked on by the development team. It's often the starting point for creating feature branches (where new features are developed) and hotfix branches (for urgent fixes).

Each package is tagged with beta version numbers, and published to npm such as `@ohif/ui@3.6.0-beta.1`

### `release` branch - The latest stable release

This branch represents the latest stable version of the project that is considered ready for production. The code in this branch should be fully tested and vetted for release. Once the code in the master branch reaches a state where it's stable and ready to be released to users,
we do a comprehensive code review and QA testing. Once the code is approved,
we merge it into the release branch and tag a new release.

Each package is tagged with version numbers, and published to npm such as `@ohif/ui@3.5.0`

Note: `master` is always ahead of `release` branch. We publish both docker builds for beta and stable releases.

Here is a schematic representation of our development workflow:

## Project

The OHIF Medical Image Viewing Platform is maintained as a
[`monorepo`][monorepo]. This means that this repository, instead of containing a
single project, contains many projects. If you explore our project structure,
you'll see the following:
