## What?

The OHIF Medical Imaging Viewer is for viewing medical images. It can retrieve and load images from most sources and formats; render sets in 2D, 3D, and reconstructed representations; allows for the manipulation, annotation, and serialization of observations; supports internationalization, OpenID Connect, offline use, hotkeys, and many more features.

Almost everything offers some degree of customization and configuration. If it doesn't support something you need, we accept pull requests and have an ever improving Extension System.

## Why Choose Us

### Community & Experience

The OHIF Viewer is a collaborative effort that has served as the basis for many active, production, and FDA Cleared medical imaging viewers. It benefits from our extensive community's collective experience, and from the sponsored contributions of individuals, research groups, and commercial organizations.

### Built to Adapt

## Quick Start Deployment

> This is only one of many ways to configure and deploy the OHIF Viewer. To learn more about your options, and how to choose the best one for your requirements, check out [our deployment recipes and documentation](https://docs.ohif.org/deployment/).

The fastest and easiest way to get started is to include the OHIF Viewer with a script tag. In practice, this is as simple as:

- Including the following dependencies with script tags:
   - [React](https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.production.min.js)
   - [React Dom](https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.production.min.js)
   - The [OHIF Viewer](https://unpkg.com/@ohif/viewer)
- Have an element with an ID of `root` on the page
- Configure the OHIF Viewer at `window.config`:

```js
window.config = {
  routerBasename: "/",
  servers: {
    dicomWeb: [
      {
        name: "DCM4CHEE",
        qidoRoot: "https://server.dcmjs.org/dcm4chee-arc/aets/DCM4CHEE/rs",
        wadoRoot: "https://server.dcmjs.org/dcm4chee-arc/aets/DCM4CHEE/rs",
        qidoSupportsIncludeField: true,
        imageRendering: "wadors",
        thumbnailRendering: "wadors"
      }
    ]
  }
};
```

- Install the viewer: `window.OHIFStandaloneViewer.installViewer(window.config);`

This exact setup is demonstrated in this [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/ohif-viewer-script-tag-usage-c4u4t) and in our [Embedding The Viewer](https://docs.ohif.org/deployment/recipes/embedded-viewer.html) deployment recipe.

## Developing

### Requirements

- [Yarn 1.17.3+](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
- [Node 8+](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Yarn Workspaces should be enabled on your machine:
  - `yarn config set workspaces-experimental true`

### Getting Started

1. [Fork this repository][how-to-fork]
2. [Clone your forked repository][how-to-clone]
   - `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Viewers.git`
3. Navigate to the cloned project's directory
4. Add this repo as a `remote` named `upstream`
   - `git remote add upstream https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers.git`
5. `yarn install` to restore dependencies and link projects

#### To Develop

_From this repository's root directory:_

```bash
# Enable Yarn Workspaces
yarn config set workspaces-experimental true

# Restore dependencies
yarn install
```

## Commands

These commands are available from the root directory. Each project directory also supports a number of commands that can be found in their respective `README.md` and `project.json` files.

| Yarn Commands        | Description                                                   |

| `dev` or `start`     | Default development experience for Viewer                     |
| `dev:project <package-name>` | Replace with `core`, `ui`, `i18n`, `cornerstone`, `vtk`, etc. |
| `test:unit`          | Jest multi-project test runner; overall coverage              |
| **Deploy**           |                                                               |
| `build`*             | Builds production output for our PWA Viewer                   |
| `build:package`*             | Builds production `commonjs` output for our Viewer                 |
| `build:package-all`*     | Builds commonjs bundles for all projects                      |
